# Deep_Reinforcement_Learning

This practical work intends to be the starting point for the development of a Deep Reinforcement Learning
(DRL) algorithm using the Python development environment together with Tensorflow and OpenAI Gym
libraries. For this, it will be necessary to develop a DRL algorithm capable of learning to play the game *Breakout* from Atari 2600”


Based on: https://github.com/ShanHaoYu/Deep-Q-Network-Breakout

### How to run
```bash
cd Breakout
python qlearn.py -m "CTrain"
```
